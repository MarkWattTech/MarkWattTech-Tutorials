## üíª Software Requirements

The following software must be installed and set up:

| Software          | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| [Nextion Editor](https://nextion.tech/nextion-editor/) | Used to design and build the touchscreen interface (HMI file). |
| [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/)       | Central hub that manages devices, automations, and the interface for notifications and toggles. |
| [ESPHome](https://esphome.io/)                          | Used to compile and upload firmware to the ESP32, and bridge communication between hardware and Home Assistant. |

All three are essential for full functionality.
<br>
<br>

## ‚úÖ Compatible Desks

The following software must be installed and set up:

| Desk               | Controller Model Number |
|--------------------|-------------------------|
| [Flexispot E7Q](https://flexispot.co.uk/4-leg-standing-desk-e7q) | U                       |


<br>


## ‚öôÔ∏è The ESPHome Section

1. **Clone this repo** or copy the `DeskController.yaml` file into your ESPHome dashboard
2. Edit the substitution values (5 sections):
   ```yaml
   substitutions:
     min_height: "79"    # Your desk's min height + 0.1
     max_height: "113"   # Your desk's max height - 0.1
   ```
3. Replace these Home Assistant entities with your own:
   - `light.left_key_light`
   - `light.right_key_light`
   - `light.ring_light`
   - `switch.playroom_light`
   - `fan.office_fan`
4. Flash to your ESP32 via USB or OTA
5. Connect your Nextion display (TX/RX/GND) to GPIOs 4 and 5 (adjust as needed)
6. Optionally update or load the `.hmi` file to match your screen layout
